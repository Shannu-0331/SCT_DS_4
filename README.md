🚦 Traffic Accident Data Analysis – Task 4 | SkillCraftTechnology Internship

This project is part of my Data Science internship at SkillCraftTechnology.  
In Task 4, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a traffic accident dataset to uncover patterns and visualize key insights.

🔍 Objective

To analyze traffic accident data and identify patterns based on:
- Road conditions
- Weather conditions
- Time of day
- Light conditions
- Accident severity

📁 Files Included
- SCT_DS_4.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with complete code and visualizations

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

📊 Key Insights
- Accident frequency by hour of the day  
- Impact of road and weather conditions on accident severity  
- Influence of light conditions on accident rates  
- Visualization of accident hotspots  

📚 Skills Gained
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data visualization and pattern recognition  
- Understanding real-world data applications  


Successfully completed Task 4 of my internship by generating insights and creating clear visualizations to understand traffic accident patterns.
